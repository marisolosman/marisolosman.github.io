abstract = {ABSTRACT Weather regimes describe the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitudes in terms of a few circulation states that modulate regional surface weather conditions on time scales of multiple days to a few weeks. This low-dimensional representation of weather has proven useful for the study of large-scale dynamics, climate trends, flow-dependent predictability, and as proxies for applied medium- to extended-range forecasting in the energy sector, for example. Previous studies have often focused on the mean surface weather associated with a regime, with only a few commenting quantitatively on intra-regime variability. In this paper, we comprehensively quantify variability of daily surface weather within regimes and show that it cannot be ignored as mean-composite approaches can be misleading. Signal-to-noise metrics highlight regime configurations that provide windows of predictive opportunity, where surface dynamics are well controlled by the large-scale regime. We discuss in detail wintertime temperature and wind speed regime anomalies for four selected countries (Spain, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom) and show that in each case there is impactful intra-regime variability that can be explained by different subtypes and life cycle stages of a regime. This nuance can be captured by continuous regime indices, allowing a refined application of weather regimes on the pan-European scale. This relatively simple guidance on regime interpretation and operational use comes without the need to change the underlying regime framework. An accompanying interactive archive, documenting intra-regime variability in national-scale, energy-relevant variables, supports immediate practical application of our regime analysis for all European countries.},

abstract = {Accurate climate predictions are vital for preparing for future weather and regional climate changes, helping communities and policymakers make informed decisions. The Southern Hemisphere’s summertime eddy-driven jet (EDJ) strongly influences weather, yet current models disagree on its future due to uncertainties in the response of large-scale climate phenomena to anthropogenic forcing. Our study introduces a method that integrates observations with climate model projections to better understand and predict EDJ behavior. By increasing the understanding of how the tropical and the stratospheric influences are combined, and accounting for model disagreement, we reduce uncertainty in model predictions and provide more reliable near-term climate prediction, offering a pathway to evaluate and improve model ensembles. The summertime eddy-driven jet (EDJ) in the Southern Hemisphere is a critical mediator between regional climate and large-scale phenomena, guiding synoptic systems that shape weather patterns. Uncertainties in global climate models (GCMs)-particularly in projecting changes in remote drivers like tropical warming, stratospheric polar vortex strengthening, and asymmetric tropical Pacific warming-hinder predictions of EDJ trends and associated regional outcomes. In this study, we develop a causal framework that combines observations, reanalysis datasets, and storylines estimated from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) projections to attribute past EDJ changes and predict plausible future trajectories. Our findings indicate that tropical warming has evolved along the low end of plausible CMIP trajectories, while the stratospheric polar vortex shows robust strengthening, both strongly influencing observed EDJ trends. Our results suggest that 50\% of the observed EDJ latitude shift can be directly attributed to global warming (GW), and the remaining 50\% to remote drivers whose attribution to GW remains uncertain. Importantly, GCMs appear to accurately estimate the observed latitudinal shifts but underestimate the observed strengthening of the EDJ, while the proposed storylines are able to capture the observed trend. By integrating causal inference with climate storylines, our approach narrows the divide between attribution and prediction, offering a physically grounded method to estimate plausible pathways of future climate change.}}

abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years, rapid growth in wind power generation has driven a strong demand for skilful wind speed forecasts, especially in regions with high-quality wind resources, such as Argentina. To date, most surface wind speed forecast analyses and applications have been focused on micrometeorological and synoptic timescales. This paper presents the first assessment of the predictability and skill of 10-m height wind speed forecasts over Argentina during the austral summer. The analysis focuses on the three-month mean for December–January–February (DJF), using one-month lead-time predictions from two seasonal forecast systems: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system 5 (SEAS5) and the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). Predictability was assessed through the decomposition of model variance into signal and noise components, and the calculation of potential predictability and perfect-model skill. The forecast skill of the ensemble mean was evaluated using several verification indices. Predictability and deterministic forecast skill are higher for CFSv2. Significant predictability is found in most of Argentina for CFSv2. Both models exhibit poor deterministic forecast skill. A more detailed analysis was conducted in three regions with a high density of wind farms, evaluating both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Three-year-out cross-validation was used to build the probabilistic forecasts for three categories based on the terciles of the distribution, and for two simplified categories of events above and below the median. The models demonstrate higher reliability and discrimination ability for predicting median-based events compared to tercile-based categories.},

   abstract = {Variability of the Surface Air Temperature (SAT) over the Western South Asia (WSA) region leads to frequent heatwaves during the early summer (May-June) season. The present study uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast’s fifth-generation seasonal prediction system, SEAS5, from 1981 to 2022 based on April initial conditions (1-month lead) to assess the SAT predictability during early summer season. The goal is to evaluate the SEAS5’s ability to predict the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related interannual variability and predictability of the SAT over WSA, which is mediated through upper-level (200-hPa) geopotential height anomalies. This teleconnection leads to anomalously warm surface conditions over the region during the negative ENSO phase, as observed in the reanalysis and SEAS5. We evaluate SEAS5 prediction skill against two observations and three reanalyses datasets. The SEAS5 SAT prediction skill is higher with high spatial resolution observations and reanalysis datasets compared to the ones with low-resolution. Overall, SEAS5 shows reasonable skill in predicting SAT and its variability over the WSA region. Moreover, the predictability of SAT during La Niña is comparable to El Niño years over the WSA region.},

   abstract = {Recently, we are witnessing a growing interest in the study of climate narratives and storylines. These are seen as critical tools both for improving shared understandings involving different stakeholders (including scientists from different disciplines) and guiding initiatives for transformative adaptation actions and decision making. This paper approaches the storylines about a severe drought event that took place in southeastern South America (SESA) in 2008/2009 from an interdisciplinary dialogue between climatologists and anthropologists. This approach responds to the need for a more robust understanding of the event and the responses adopted locally, i.e: not restricted to physical aspects but considering socio-economic and political aspects, with the aim of contributing to the development of socially relevant climatic information for realistic climate risk decision making contexts. In particular it intends to contribute to the decision-making processes of government agencies focused on climate communication and public climate services, such as national and weather services and regional agencies. Considering disciplinary differences, we account for the interpretative polyphony regarding this event, i.e.: what each actor/sector is talking about (for what and to whom they are talking about) when referring to "the drought", and analyze climate storylines as an agonistic field of meanings. This implies recognizing the disputes and contradictions among them, how different storylines promote certain lines of argumentation and meanings to the detriment of others, knowledge gaps, the role of social power relations, socio-political order factors and their impact in terms of the necessary transformations towards an environmentally sustainable and socially just horizon.},

   abstract = {<p>Reliable forecasts of quasi‐stationary, recurrent, and persistent large‐scale atmospheric circulation patterns—so‐called weather regimes—are crucial for various socio‐economic sectors, including energy, health, and agriculture. Despite steady progress, probabilistic weather regime predictions still exhibit biases in the exact timing and amplitude of weather regimes. This study thus aims at advancing probabilistic weather regime predictions in the North Atlantic–European region through ensemble post‐processing. Here, we focus on the representation of seven year‐round weather regimes in sub‐seasonal to seasonal reforecasts of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The manifestation of each of the seven regimes can be expressed by a continuous weather regime index, representing the projection of the instantaneous 500‐hPa geopotential height anomalies (A) onto the respective mean regime pattern. We apply a two‐step ensemble post‐processing involving first univariate ensemble model output statistics and second ensemble copula coupling, which restores the multivariate dependence structure. Compared with current forecast calibration practices, which rely on correcting the field by the lead‐time‐dependent mean bias, our approach extends the forecast skill horizon for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts moderately by 1 day (from 13.5 to 14.5 days). Additionally, to our knowledge our study is the first to evaluate the multivariate aspects of forecast quality systematically for weather regime forecasts. Our method outperforms current practices in the multivariate aspect, as measured by the energy and variogram score. Still, our study shows that, even with advanced post‐processing, weather regime prediction becomes difficult beyond 14 days, which likely points towards intrinsic limits of predictability for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts. The proposed method can easily be applied to operational weather regime forecasts, offering a neat alternative for cost‐ and time‐efficient post‐processing of real‐time weather regime forecasts.</p>},

   abstract = {Under the pressing warming of climate, interpretable and useful-for-adaptation information has become a need in society and has promoted rapid methodological advances in climate science. One such advance is the development of the dynamical-storyline approach, with which the spread in multi-model scenario projections can be represented as a set of physically plausible scenarios (storylines) defined by (a) a global warming level and (b) changes in large-scale dynamical conditions that arise from climate forcing. Moreover, if changes in regional climate are assessed in such a way that they can clearly inform societal systems or management of natural ecosystems, they can potentially aid decision-making in a practical manner. Such is the aim of the climatic impact-driver (CID) framework, proposed in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Here, we combine the dynamical-storyline approach with the CID framework and apply them to climate services. We focus on CIDs associated with the viticulture sector and the region of the South American Andes, where currently both Argentina and Chile produce wine. We explain the benefits of this approach from a communication and adaptation perspective. In particular, we found that the CIDs related to seasonally aggregated temperatures are mainly dependent on the global warming level although in some regions, but they can also be sensitive to changes in dynamical conditions. Meanwhile, CIDs related to extreme temperature values and precipitation depend strongly on the dynamical response. We show how adaptation to climate-related compound risks can be informed by a storyline approach, given that they can address compound uncertainty in multiple locations, variables and seasons.},

Here we investigate the flow-dependence of this uncertainty during Boreal winter. We categorize the large-scale flow using North Atlantic-European weather regimes. First, we show that forecast uncertainty of near-surface geopotential height (Z1000) and temperature (T2m) are strongly sensitive to the prevailing regime. Specifically, forecast uncertainty of Z1000 reduces over northern Europe following Greenland Blocking (enhanced predictability) due to a southward shifting eddy-driven jet. However, due to strong temperature gradients and variable flow patterns, Greenland blocking is linked to increased forecast uncertainty of T2m over Europe (reduced predictability). Second, we show that forecast uncertainty of weather regimes is modulated via the stratospheric polar vortex. Weak polar vortex states tend to reduce regime-uncertainty, for example, due to more frequent predicted occurrence of Greenland blocking. These regime changes are associated with increased T2m uncertainty over Europe.},

   abstract = {Summer rainfall trends in southeastern South America (SE-SA) have received attention in recent decades because of their importance for climate impacts. More than one driving mechanism has been identified for the trends, some of which have opposing effects. It is still not clear how much each mechanism has contributed to the observed trends or how their combined influence will affect future changes. Here, we address the second question and study how the CMIP6 summer SE-SA rainfall response to greenhouse warming can be explained by mechanisms related to large-scale extratropical circulation responses in the Southern Hemisphere to remote drivers (RDs) of regional climate change. We find that the regional uncertainty is well represented by combining the influence of four RDs: tropical upper-tropospheric amplification of surface warming, the delay in the stratospheric polar vortex breakdown date, and two RDs characterizing recognized tropical Pacific SST warming patterns. Applying a storyline framework, we identify the combination of RD responses that lead to the most extreme drying and wetting scenarios. Although most scenarios involve wetting, SE-SA drying can result if high upper-tropospheric tropical warming and early stratospheric polar vortex breakdown conditions are combined with low central and eastern Pacific warming. We also show how the definition of the SE-SA regional box can impact the results since the spatial patterns characterizing the dynamical influences are complex and the rainfall changes can be averaged out if these are not considered when aggregating. This article’s perspective and the associated methodology are applicable to other regions of the globe.},

Therefore, the relation between precipitation levels, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil water content was explored, being the soil water content the index with the better performance. By means of a correlation and regression analysis, it was found that in the major number of cases soil water content explains at least 50% percent of the variability in soybean yields, with a maximum of 70% explanatory power in one county. Also, forecast capacity was tested through leave one out validation technique, showing that models are robust enough to provide a one period forecast, as error is mostly explained by the standard deviation of the yield index. The main applications of this finding are related to impact evaluation before final harvesting and the design of index-based insurance.},

   abstract = {The prediction skill of sub-seasonal forecast models is evaluated for seven year-round weather regimes in the Atlantic–European region. Reforecasts based on models from three prediction centers are considered and verified against weather regimes obtained from ERA-Interim reanalysis. Results show that predicting weather regimes as a proxy for the large-scale circulation outperforms the prediction of raw geopotential height. Greenland blocking tends to have the longest year-round skill horizon for all three models, especially in winter. On the other hand, the skill is lowest for the European blocking regime for all three models, followed by the Scandinavian blocking regime. Furthermore, all models struggle to forecast flow situations that cannot be assigned to a weather regime (so-called no regime), in comparison with weather regimes. Related to this, variability in the occurrence of no regime, which is most frequent in the transition seasons, partly explains the predictability gap between transition seasons and winter and summer. We also show that models have difficulties in discriminating between related regimes. This can lead to misassignments in the predicted regime during flow situations in which related regimes manifest. Finally, we document the changes in skill between model versions, showing important improvements for the ECMWF and NCEP models. This study is the first multi-model assessment of year-round weather regimes in the Atlantic–European domain. It advances our understanding of the predictive skill for weather regimes, reveals strengths and weaknesses of each model, and thus increases our confidence in the forecasts and their usefulness for decision-making.},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. The stratosphere can be a source of predictability for surface weather on timescales of several weeks to months. However, the potential predictive skill gained from stratospheric variability can be limited by biases in the representation of stratospheric processes and the coupling of the stratosphere with surface climate in forecast systems. This study provides a first systematic identification of model biases in the stratosphere across a wide range of subseasonal forecast systems. It is found that many of the forecast systems considered exhibit warm global-mean temperature biases from the lower to middle stratosphere, too strong/cold wintertime polar vortices, and too cold extratropical upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere regions. Furthermore, tropical stratospheric anomalies associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation tend to decay toward each system's climatology with lead time. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), most systems do not capture the seasonal cycle of extreme-vortex-event probabilities, with an underestimation of sudden stratospheric warming events and an overestimation of strong vortex events in January. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), springtime interannual variability in the polar vortex is generally underestimated, but the timing of the final breakdown of the polar vortex often happens too early in many of the prediction systems. These stratospheric biases tend to be considerably worse in systems with lower model lid heights. In both hemispheres, most systems with low-top atmospheric models also consistently underestimate the upward wave driving that affects the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex. We expect that the biases identified here will help guide model development for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast systems and further our understanding of the role of the stratosphere in predictive skill in the troposphere.</p>},

   abstract = {This paper evaluates the predictability and skill of the models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble project (NMME) in South America on seasonal timescales using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results show that the temperature variance is dominated by the multi-model ensemble signal in the austral autumn and summer and by the inter-model biases in the austral spring and winter. The temperature predictability is higher at low latitudes, although moderate values are found in extratropical latitudes in the austral spring and summer. The predictability of precipitation is lower than that of temperature because noise dominates the variance. The highest levels of precipitation predictability are reached in tropical latitudes with large inter-seasonal variations. Southeastern South America and Patagonia present the highest predictability at midlatitudes. The NMME skill of temperature is better than that of precipitation, and it is better at low latitudes for both variables. At extratropical latitudes, the skill is moderate for temperature and low for precipitation, although precipitation reaches a local maximum in southeastern South America.},

   abstract = {The influence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Stratospheric Polar Vortex (SPV) on the zonal asymmetries in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation during spring and summer is examined. The main objective of the work is to explore if the SPV can modulate the ENSO teleconnections in the extratropics. We use a large ensemble of seasonal hindcasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecast System to provide a much larger sample size than is possible from the observations alone. We find a small but statistically significant relationship between ENSO and the SPV, with El Niño events occurring with weak SPV and La Niña events occurring with strong SPV more often than expected by chance, in agreement with previous works. We show that the zonally asymmetric response to ENSO and SPV can be mainly explained by a linear combination of the response to both forcings, and that they can combine constructively or destructively. However the nature of this interference evolves through the spring and summer period, and is not aligned with the traditional seasons. From this perspective, we find that the tropospheric asymmetries in response to ENSO are more intense when El Niño events occur with weak SPV and La Niña events occur with strong SPV, at least from September through December. In the stratosphere, the ENSO teleconnections are mostly confounded by the SPV signal. The analysis of Rossby Wave Source and of wave activity shows that both are stronger when El Niño events occur together with weak SPV, and when La Niña events occur together with strong SPV.},

This work assessed the performance of the predictions initialized in November to forecast the austral summer (December–January–February) for the period 1982–2010 using different probabilistic measures. Results show that the consolidated forecasts produce more skillful forecast than the simple multi-model ensemble, although no major differences were found between the combination and weighting approaches considered.

   abstract = {The latitude of separation of the Brazil Current (LSBC) variability is analyzed with a view to unveiling the physical mechanisms that modulate the turning point of the Brazil Current at low frequencies. The global ocean reanalysis ORAP5.0 spanning the period 1979–2013 is employed for this purpose. Three characteristic periodicities of the LSBC variability are found on the basis of a Singular Spectrum Analysis: 2, 4 and 10 years. Lagged sea surface height (SSH) correlation maps relate these modulations to Rossby wave propagation. According to these maps, the biennial signal might be triggered by the Atlantic Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole. In the last case, SSH anomalies propagate around the southern tip of Africa, connecting the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Correlation maps suggest that the 4-year signal is triggered by both the Atlantic Niño and the ENSO in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The ENSO-related anomalies travel through the Indonesian Throughflow along the western Australian coast, where Rossby waves are excited. These anomalies propagate to the eastern coast of Madagascar and feed into the Agulhas Current, eventually leaking into the Atlantic basin. Finally, the decadal signal is associated to the leading mode of decadal variability of the South Pacific Ocean. SSH propagating patterns derived from ORAP5.0 data are also obtained with satellite altimetry during the overlapping period (1993–2013), which strengthens confidence in our results. The association of the LSCB modulations to characteristic climate variability modes suggests that the position of the LSCB could be predicted.},

The aim of the present study is to investigate the ability of two S2S project models (ECMWF and NCEP) to detect the Southern Hemisphere teleconnections in model hindcasts and the associated anomalous precipitation over South America. The period of analyses is 1999–2010 for the austral summer season (December–January–February). Both models represented adequately the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) pattern in predictions up to 4 weeks ahead and the Pacific South America (PSA) pattern up to 3 weeks. Atmospheric variables of observed extreme cases of SAM were well predicted by the two models, 2 and 3 weeks in advance. The models predicted well atmospheric variables in observed extreme cases of PSA, 2 weeks in advance and with less intensity in the third week. Precipitation anomaly signals associated with these modes were well predicted 2 weeks in advance, although with different intensities. The good ability of the models hindcast in predicting teleconnection patterns and precipitation anomalies over South America provides more confidence to use predictions at sub-seasonal timescale.},

During the present century, global warming (GW) is expected to contribute to a positive SAM trend while ozone recovery is expected to act in the opposite direction. Here, Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation and regional precipitation change are studied with a methodology that separates the effects from GW and ozone depletion/recovery. Our results show that a “tug-of-war” between ozone and GW occurs in the summertime stratosphere, propagating to the troposphere where it is manifest in the SAM. However, at the regional scale this “tug-of-war” is not as relevant as the combined effects of other remote drivers of circulation change, which force different kinds of precipitation changes in the SH. For regional precipitation changes, the uncertainty in future circulation change is as important as the uncertainty in the GW level.},

A regional validation of the dataset is performed to evaluate the ocean reanalysis ability to solve the main features associated with the plume dynamics. Following the satisfactory evaluation, an Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis is performed to extract characteristic modes of variability of the sea surface salinity. Three leading modes explain 35%, 30% and 15% of the total variance and are associated with large scale atmospheric variability patterns characteristic of the Southern Hemisphere circulation. Mode 1 is characterized by marked salinity anomalies to the south and north of the RdlP Estuary mouth. Its particular imprint is associated with an organized alongshelf wind structure modulated by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Mode 2 presents salinity anomalies that extend from the RdlP Estuary to the Uruguayan and southern Brazilian coasts and is related to interannual variability of the RdlP discharge and to regional wind forcing over the plume. Both the river outflow and the atmospheric forcing over the shelf are strongly associated with the Pacific South American pattern (PSA1). Finally, mode 3 presents large salinity anomalies at 38°S, south of the mouth of the RdlP Estuary and is associated with displacements of the freshwater plume due to local wind stress anomalies over the estuary, which are modulated by the PSA2.},

This study aims to assess the subseasonal temperature prediction quality of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) against the Japan Meteorological Agency reanalyses. Two consecutive weeks of July 2017 were analyzed, which presented anomalously cold and warm conditions over central South America. The quality of 20 years of hindcasts for the two investigated weeks was compared to that for similar weeks during the JJA season and of 3 years of real-time forecasts for the same season. Anomalously cold temperatures observed during the week of 17–23 July 2017 were well predicted one week in advance. Moreover, the warm anomalies observed during the following week of 24–30 July 2017 were well predicted two weeks in advance. Higher linear association and discrimination (ability to distinguish events from nonevents), but reduced reliability, was found for the 20 years of hindcasts for the target week than for the hindcasts produced for all of the JJA season. In addition, the real-time forecasts showed generally better performance over some regions of South America than the hindcasts. The assessment provides robust evidence about temperature prediction quality to build confidence in regional subseasonal forecasts as well as to identify regions in which the predictions have better performance.},

   abstract = {One of the major globally relevant systematic biases in previous generations of climate models has been an equatorward bias in the latitude of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitude tropospheric eddy driven westerly jet. The far-reaching implications of this for Southern Ocean heat and carbon uptake and Antarctic land and sea ice are key reasons why addressing this bias is a high priority. It is therefore of primary importance to evaluate the representation of the SH westerly jet in the latest generation of global climate and earth system models that comprise the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). In this paper we assess the representation of major indices of SH extratropical atmospheric circulation in CMIP6 by comparison against both observations and the previous generation of CMIP5 models. Indices assessed are the latitude and speed of the westerly jet, variability of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and representation of the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL). These are calculated from the historical forcing simulations of both CMIP5 and CMIP6 for time periods matching available observational and reanalysis data sets. From the 39 CMIP6 models available at the time of writing there is an overall reduction in the equatorward bias of the annual mean westerly jet from 1.9° in CMIP5 to 0.4° in CMIP6 and from a seasonal perspective the reduction is clearest in austral spring and summer. This is accompanied by a halving of the bias of SAM decorrelation timescales compared to CMIP5. However, no such overall improvements are evident for the ASL.},

   abstract = {As evidence of climate change strengthens, knowledge of its regional implications becomes an urgent need for decision making. Current understanding of regional precipitation changes is substantially limited by our understanding of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change, which to a high degree remains uncertain. This uncertainty is reflected in the wide spread in atmospheric circulation changes projected in multimodel ensembles, which cannot be directly interpreted in a probabilistic sense. The uncertainty can instead be represented by studying a discrete set of physically plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation changes. By mining CMIP5 model output, here we take this broader perspective and develop storylines for Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude circulation changes, conditioned on the degree of global-mean warming, based on the climate responses of two remote drivers: the enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex. For the three continental domains in the SH, we analyse the precipitation changes under each storyline. To allow comparison with previous studies, we also link both circulation and precipitation changes with those of the Southern Annular Mode. Our results show that the response to tropical warming leads to a strengthening of the midlatitude westerly winds, whilst the response to a delayed breakdown (for DJF) or strengthening (for JJA) of the stratospheric vortex leads to a poleward shift of the westerly winds and the storm tracks. However, the circulation response is not zonally symmetric and the regional precipitation storylines for South America, South Africa, South of Australia and New Zealand exhibit quite specific dependencies on the two remote drivers, which are not well represented by changes in the Southern Annular Mode.},

   abstract = {The climate of South America (SA) has long held an intimate connection with El Niño, historically describing anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures off the coastline of Peru. Indeed, throughout SA, precipitation and temperature exhibit a substantial, yet regionally diverse, relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, El Niño is typically accompanied by drought in the Amazon and north-eastern SA, but flooding in the tropical west coast and south-eastern SA, with marked socio-economic effects. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of ENSO teleconnections to SA. Recent efforts have sought improved understanding of ocean–atmosphere processes that govern the impact, inter-event and decadal variability, and responses to anthropogenic warming. ENSO’s impacts have been found to vary markedly, affected not only by ENSO diversity, but also by modes of variability within and outside of the Pacific. However, while the understanding of ENSO–SA relationships has improved, with implications for prediction and projection, uncertainty remains in regards to the robustness of the impacts, inter-basin climate interactions and interplay with greenhouse warming. A coordinated international effort is, therefore, needed to close the observational, theoretical and modelling gaps currently limiting progress, with specific efforts in extending palaeoclimate proxies further back in time, reducing systematic model errors and improving simulations of ENSO diversity and teleconnections.},

   abstract = {The predictability and forecast skill of the models participating in the Climate Historical Forecast Project (CHFP) database is assessed through evaluating the representation of the upper-tropospheric extratropical circulation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in winter and summer and its main modes of variability. In summer, the predictability of 200-hPa geopotential height anomalies mainly comes from the ability of the multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM) to forecast the first three modes of interannual variability with high fidelity. The MMEM can reproduce not only the spatial patterns of these modes but also their temporal evolution. On the other hand, in JJA only the second and fourth modes of variability are predictable by the MMEM. These seasonal differences in the performance of the MMEM seem to be related to the role that the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies have in influencing the variability of each mode. Accordingly, modes that are strongly linked to tropical SST anomalies are better forecast by the MMEM and show less spread among models. The analysis of both 2-m temperature and precipitation anomalies in the SH associated with the predictable modes reveals that DJF predictable modes are accompanied by significant temperature anomalies. In particular, temperatures at polar (tropical) latitudes are significantly correlated with the first (second) mode. Furthermore, these links obtained with observations are also well forecast by the MMEM and can help to improve seasonal forecast of climate anomalies in those regions with low skill.},

   abstract = {In the second fortnight of December 2013, the longest heat wave registered until then occurred in Buenos Aires city and over a large region of Argentina, with large socio-economic impacts. Excess heat indexes were used to characterize this heat wave, which occurred within the warm season with largest number of heat wave days. This extreme event resulted in the longest consecutive period of heat wave conditions between 1979 and 2014. This event was the result of the combined activity of short intraseasonal (10–30 days), long intraseasonal (30–90 days) and larger (more than 90 days) time scales. Accounting for the lower frequency, dry soil moisture anomalies were observed in Argentina during autumn, winter and spring of 2013 probably favoring more extreme values in the temperature anomalies. Weekly geopotential heights anomalies computed during the event showed that the combination of the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode and a wave-4 pattern at midlatitudes favored the development of positive geopotential height anomalies over southern South America which promoted subsidence motions there. Intraseasonal variability played a key role in the persistence of the heat wave. The development of an MJO event over the Indian Ocean (RMM phase 3) 12 days prior to the beginning of the heat wave may have contributed to organize the extratropical wave train which in turn favored the anticyclonic upper-level anomaly development over southern South America. Furthermore, an intense SACZ event during the first 12 days of the heat wave favored clear-sky conditions and diabatic heating as well as subsidence, while during the last days it was the northerly advection of warmer air in the 10–30-day time scale that maintained the intensity of the temperature anomalies.},

   abstract = {Previous studies documented that El Niño (EN) events are in general associated with negative phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). EN 2015–2016 (EN15–16) was one of the three strongest events ever recorded. However, it was associated with a SAM positive phase of extreme intensity. Furthermore, while the negative linear relationship between ENSO and SAM during the most recent period (1986–2014) was significant and associated with a narrow uncertainty band, the combined condition of both climate patterns in the EN15–16 event was an outlier. The EN15–16 influence on the austral summer circulation anomalies at the extratropical and polar regions of the Southern Hemisphere was considerably altered by the strong SAM positive phase, which was evident not only at the troposphere but also at the stratosphere. Such circulation changes resulted in unusual regional impacts, such as negative anomalies of surface air temperature in western Antarctic Peninsula and negative precipitation anomalies in southeastern South America, ever recorded for previous strong EN events. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms explaining the SAM behaviour during 2015–2016 and its implication for climate predictability on seasonal timescales.},

   abstract = {The prediction skill of subseasonal forecast models is evaluated for a strong and long-lasting heat wave occurred in December 2013 over Southern South America. Reforecasts from two models participating in the WCRP/WWRP Subseasonal to Seasonal project, the Bureau of Meteorology POAMA and Beijing Climate Center model BCC-CPS were considered to evaluate their skill in forecasting temperature and circulation anomalies during that event. The POAMA reforecast of 32-member ensemble size, initialized every five days, and BCC-CPS reforecast of 4-member ensemble size for the same date of POAMA plus the previous 4 days were considered. Weekly ensemble-mean forecasts were computed with leadtimes from 2 days up to 24 days every 5 days. Weekly anomalies were calculated for observations from 13th of December to 31st of December 2013. Anomalies for both observations and reforecast were calculated with respect to their own climatology. Results show that the ensemble mean warm anomalies forecasted for week 1 and 2 of the heat wave resulted more similar to the observations for the POAMA model, especially for longer leads. The BCC-CPS performed better for leads shorter than 7 (14) for week 1 (2). For week 3 the BCC-CPS outperformed the POAMA model, particularly at shorter leads, locating more accurately the maxima of the anomalies. In a probabilistic approach, POAMA predicted with a higher chance than BCC-CPS the excess of the upper tercile of temperature anomalies for almost every week and lead time. The forecast of the circulation anomalies over South America could be used to explain the location of the highest temperature anomalies. In summary, for this case, models skill in forecasting surface temperature in a context of a heat wave resulted moderate at lead times longer than the fortnight. However, this study is limited to model-to-model analysis and a multi-model ensemble strategy might increase the skill.},

   abstract = {This work presents an assessment of the predictability and skill of climate anomalies over South America. The study was made considering a multi-model ensemble of seasonal forecasts for surface air temperature, precipitation and regional circulation, from coupled global circulation models included in the Climate Historical Forecast Project. Predictability was evaluated through the estimation of the signal-to-total variance ratio while prediction skill was assessed computing anomaly correlation coefficients. Both indicators present over the continent higher values at the tropics than at the extratropics for both, surface air temperature and precipitation. Moreover, predictability and prediction skill for temperature are slightly higher in DJF than in JJA while for precipitation they exhibit similar levels in both seasons. The largest values of predictability and skill for both variables and seasons are found over northwestern South America while modest but still significant values for extratropical precipitation at southeastern South America and the extratropical Andes. The predictability levels in ENSO years of both variables are slightly higher, although with the same spatial distribution, than that obtained considering all years. Nevertheless, predictability at the tropics for both variables and seasons diminishes in both warm and cold ENSO years respect to that in all years. The latter can be attributed to changes in signal rather than in the noise. Predictability and prediction skill for low-level winds and upper-level zonal winds over South America was also assessed. Maximum levels of predictability for low-level winds were found were maximum mean values are observed, i.e. the regions associated with the equatorial trade winds, the midlatitudes westerlies and the South American Low-Level Jet. Predictability maxima for upper-level zonal winds locate where the subtropical jet peaks. Seasonal changes in wind predictability are observed that seem to be related to those associated with the signal, especially at the extratropics.},

   abstract = {The importance of forecasting extreme wet and dry conditions from weeks to months in advance relies on the need to prevent considerable socioeconomic losses, mainly in regions of large populations and where agriculture is a key value for the economies, such as southern South America (SSA). To improve the understanding of the performance and uncertainties of seasonal soil moisture and precipitation forecasts over SSA, this study aims to 1) perform a general assessment of the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), soil moisture and precipitation forecasts against observations and soil moisture simulations based on GLDAS, version 2.0; 2) evaluate the ability of CFSv2 to represent wet and dry events through the forecasted standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized soil moisture anomalies (SSMA); and 3) analyze the capability of a statistical methodology (merging observations and forecasts) in representing a severe drought event. Results show that both SPI and SSMA forecast skill are regionally and seasonally dependent. In general, a fast degradation of the forecasts skill is observed as the lead time increases, resulting in almost no added value with regard to climatology at lead times longer than 3 months. Additionally, a better performance of the SSMA forecasts is observed compared to SPI calculated using three months of precipitation (SPI3), with a higher skill for dry events against wet events. The CFSv2 forecasts are able to represent the spatial patterns of the 2008/09 severe drought event, although it shows crucial limitations regarding the identification of drought onset, duration, severity, and demise, considering both meteorological (SPI) and agricultural (SSMA) drought conditions.},

   abstract = {An assessment of the predictability and prediction skill of the tropospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere was done. The analysis is based on seasonal forecasts of geopotential heights at 200, 500 and 850 hPa, for austral summer and winter from 11 models participating in the Climate Historical Forecast Project. It is found that predictability (signal-to-variance ratio) and prediction skill (anomaly correlation) in the tropics is higher than in the extratropics and is also higher in summer than in winter. Both predictability and skill are higher at high than at low altitudes. Modest values of predictability and skill are found at polar latitudes in the Bellinghausen-Amundsen Seas. The analysis of the changes in predictability and prediction skill in ENSO events reveals that both are slightly higher in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years than in all years, while the spatial patterns of maxima and minima remain unchanged. Changes in signal-to-noise ratio observed are mainly due to signal changes rather than changes in noise. Composites of geopotential heights anomalies for El Niño and La Niña years are in agreement with observations.},
