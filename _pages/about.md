Welcome to my website.I am [Associate Researcher at Centro de Investigaciones del Mar y la Atmósfera](http://www.cima.fcen.uba.ar/personal.php?p=I) and Professor at the [Departamento de Ciencias de la Atmósfera, Universidad de Buenos Aires](http://www.at.fcen.uba.ar) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I hold PhD and Diploma degrees from the Department of Meteorology at the University of Buenos Aires.

My [research](https://marisolosman.github.io/research/) mainly focuses on variability, predictability and prediction skill on subseasonal and seasonal timescales, including the applications of forecast products in different economic sectors, such as agriculture and energy and the development of forecast tools.

About me
======

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Coming from a town of farmers, I was always interested in how climate variability affects agricultural activity. During my Diploma and PhD, which I completed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I worked on climate predictability and prediction on seasonal timescales over the Southern Hemisphere and South America. During my postdoc I developed a probabilistic seasonal forecasting system for South America that is now used by the [Argentinian Weather Service](https://www.crc-sas.org/en/prevision_modelo_previsao_as.php). As a researcher, I worked on interdisciplinary projects with anthropologists, economists as well as farmers to co-design and co-produce forecasting tools for the agricultural sector on subseasonal and seasonal timescales.

During 2021-2023 I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Troposphere Research-Institute of Meteorology and Climate at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. My project focused on the predictability of different variables relevant for the energy sector on weather and subseasonal timescales. The project was run in collaboration with AXPO solutions.

Back in Buenos Aires I work as researcher and professor on subseasonal to seasonal prediction doing research on predictability and applications of forecast by multiple stakeholders.
